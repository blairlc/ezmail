            <h2>EZ Mail Plan Pricing</h2>
            <p>Based on our research we discovered that this type of product is usually a subscription service. Most of our possible competitors have a price of $5-8 dollars per month for the subscription service, including interface and email address. We chose to price ours at $6 per month. Our product includes the same features as our competitors, but with an added focus on general accessibility.  We think this price will be sustainable for our business and competitive on cost.</p>
