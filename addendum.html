            <h2>Addendum</h2>
            <p>There are a few items we still have not worked out for EZ Mail. </p>
            <p>One issue is subject lines. Most aspects of email have equivalents in a physical letter that can be pointed out by using the same vocabulary. However, letters do not have any kind of subject line written on them. We hope that calling it a title will help users understand that they should write a few words describing the content of their email. This would have to be checked with user testing and if it is confusing it should be removed entirely.</p>
            <p>Another issue is logging in. We discussed this process at length and came up with a few things that would help people with memory impairments log in. On compatible devices, users can choose to log in using a fingerprint or facial recognition. They can also choose to stay logged in. However, a user using a public desktop computer, such as in a nursing home or library, can not use these features. We decided to instruct users to use a phrase as their password and keep it written down in a safe place. This is not the most secure and still requires some memory but we think it is a good compromise. The user will also specify a “helper” during account setup who can be contacted if the password needs to be reset.</p>
