                <img src="SetupEmail.png" alt="Picture of email setup screen. There three steps. The first step asks for the user's name and has them choose an email address. The second step has the user pick a phrase to use as a password. It has the text You will enter this phrase to access your email. Write it down in a safe place. The thried step asks for a friend or family member's email address. It has the text This person will be contacted if there are problems with your account. Each step has next and back buttons.">
                <figcaption>It's important that our users have an helper with them when first setting up their account. Because our users are unlikely to have a backup email address, this helper will be contacted if the account is compromised or the password is forgotten. We encourage a catch phrase as the password because EZ Mail believes that it is easier to recall a password that way. </figcaption>

                <img src="HomeScreen.png" alt="Picture of home screen. There are four buttons labeled Read Emails, Write an Email, Address Book, and Exit. The text Welcome back! is displayed.">
                <figcaption>We strived to go for simplicity when creating the home screen. Realizing our target audience, we wanted the easiest accessibility of the key features found in email communication.</figcaption>

                <img src="Inbox.png" alt="Picture of inbox screen. At the top there is the text My Emails and a button labeled Write an Email. Below there is a list of emails. The sender, subject, and whether it is new is displayed for each email.">
                <figcaption>We really wanted to stick with a consistent color scheme in relation to our email platform. We found the colors red, green and blue. Green acts as positive action like the term “Green means Go” while red acts as a negative action like the term “Red means Stop”. Since our main user base has a tough time learning new tasks we wanted to familiarize them with actions they’ve known for several years previously.</figcaption>

                <img src="ViewEmail.png" alt="Picture of a received email. At the top there is a red button labeled Delete and who the email is from. Next, there is the text of the email and the date it was sent. At the button there are two buttons labeled Print Email and Save Email.">
                <figcaption>When email is received this is how it is viewed. With the arrows, it allows you to scroll down the email. Also below the email it gives you option the presented in different colors whether, you want to trash the email, print the email, or save the email.</figcaption>

The second step shows recipient selection. The third step asks What is the title of the email? The fourth step has space to enter email text as well as buttons that say Dictate and Read. The fifth step shows the email draft. The last step has options to send the email or go back.">
                <figcaption>We wanted to make an easy way to know how to write an email. It directs on what to do and how to do it. After each step you click the next button and if the person wants to change something, they just click the back button.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>The address book acts as a contact book for our user’s friends on the web. All of their contacts can be easily accessed here with the help of the blue arrows positioned on the right side of the page.</figcaption>
